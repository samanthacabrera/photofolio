        This is a personal archive of places visited that felt worth holding onto.
        I am self-taught and began photographing in 2020.
        <br/><br/>
        All the photos you see are captured with a Sony Alpha a6000 under natural light and unaltered. 
        <br/><br/>
        You can reach me at <a>justinamiller1023@gmail.com</a>.
